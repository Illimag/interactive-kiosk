# UI Source Code

The UI for the Interaction Kiosk, needs to be developed with a standard Programming Language.

As of now, because it should be a web application, it should be written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

The focus is to be light-weight and minimal, with the less use of frameworks, and libraries the better.

Additionally to acheieve a Kiosk interface, we can use a Fullscreen API, or something similar.
